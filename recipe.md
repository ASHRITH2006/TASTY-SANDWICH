AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED ABOUT THE INGREDIENTS NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO THE RECIPE AND HOW IT IS MADE...

A sandwich is a food typically consisting of vegetables, sliced cheese or meat, placed on or between slices of bread, or more generally any dish wherein bread serves as a container or wrapper for another food type.

Spread mayo, butter or cream cheese all the way to the edges of each slice of bread to create a seal against wet sandwich fillings. Also, try packing high moisture ingredients, like tomatoes, pickles, and cucumbers, separately. Just add them to the sandwich when you're ready to eat.
